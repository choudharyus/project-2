## Project Description

After talking with Cindy (my girlfriend, she is RN) at the dinner table; I picked the URL from USDA/FDA about the nursing home availbility in the area. It has been challenged for the families to find the right nursing home for their loved ones. My plan to design the site that provide the families quick access to the basic information about the nursing home such as:

- Number of beds (capacity) of the nursning home 
- Quality star rating of the nursing home
- Number of nursing home available in the area
- Total number of penalities, violations or fines of the nursing home

## Here is the API link:

## Project Design
My plan is to keep the design very simple, and easy to navigate, so in order to achieve this objective; I would provide the above mentioned options in the home page with clear description and distinct colors.
